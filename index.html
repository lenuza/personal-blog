                    This is my first web page. I had the idea for some time that this is what I want to do, then
                    facebook suggested me the Udacity scolarship. I started with html and css a couple of months ago and
                    dared the Javascript a bit more recently. I really enjoy
                    and like the fact that you have the idea, you write it, test it and you know right away the outcome,
                    if not happy with the result keep the loop until you are happy! Hopefully not so far from now I
                    would be able to call myself a begginer front-end
                    developer.

                Since this is my first page what was I doing all my life? I graduated some time ago as a landscape
                architect. Traveled for some time - US, Spain, Czech Republic. Then came back home and it seems I like
                learning new things and tricks, so I kept doing it.
                In my last challenge I was studing nature, and to be more precise studing trees, conifers - Norway
                spruce (<i>Picea abies </i>(L.)Karst.) and Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.).<br /> Press any key

            <h3>Accessibility</h3> All is new and exciting, so I have to learn quite a lot. But what I find interesting
            at the moment is accessibility - fonts, colors, semantics and more. Even today if you search youtube for
            closed-captioned (CC) videos, you will discover that a
            lot of them don't have or use an auto option, which doesn't work so well.
